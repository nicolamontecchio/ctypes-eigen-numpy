Cookbook code for using ctypes/numpy/eigen

Uses a couple of tricks:

- write function in cpp that accept pointers to standard types, like float*, double*, ...
- in cpp, use the Map<VectorXf> trick (pay attention to the type, float/double/int/...)
- in ctypes, declare array argument as np.ctypeslib.ndpointer(dtype = np.float32)

that's it!

Data should also be aligned in numpy, maybe it is possible to improve that, not yet checked.
